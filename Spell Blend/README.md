# Legends of laynirau

[V0.1] -> Game itself
[Project V0.1] -> Full project with the yyz file
(Note: this game only works using the ps4 controler because i only programed that way)


Legends of laiynirau is now public.The project has the yyz file, sprites,sound and .exe file (the game it self). 
If you need any help about any project or other dought send a mail to this adress jos3ndo@gmail.com
I hope I can be helpfull in some way :D 


You need the gamemaker studio 2 to run the yyz file. 
-> Download it here: https://www.yoyogames.com/get
After you have the gms2 instaled on your machine you can open it. Once you open gms2 click on the import option and select the yyz file.
You are now on my project. If you have any trouble inside the project you might need to change your gms2 version. I use the 2.3.1
